# Experiments and real runs

Every run against a paid model, what it tested, what it showed and what changed because of it.
All runs use **synthetic people** from `backend/app/synthetic.py` (generic baselines, planted
effects), never personal data. Costs are also in the spend log in [costs.md](costs.md). These are
development checks, a handful of runs each: indicative, not the evaluation, which comes in Sprint 2
with a labeled set and held-out scenarios.

The synthetic person used unless noted: 60 days from Jul 1, 2026, seed 3, with bedtime 1 h later,
time asleep 45 min shorter, and HRV coupled to sleep, all from Aug 15.

## Experts (PR #28), 2026-10-23

| Run | Setup | Result | Changed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Recovery expert, deep: "Why has my HRV been lower lately?" | **all claims rejected**: the model wrote evidence ids into the sentences, and the verifier read their digits as unsupported numbers ($0.0217) | prompt forbids ids in text; verifier names the problem |
| 2 | Sleep expert, deep: "Has my sleep changed lately, and did my HRV move with it?" | 3 verified claims, planted change found; **did not consult recovery, yet the summary described HRV** ($0.0152) | prompt lists the metrics each other expert owns |
| 3 | Same as 2 | consulted recovery; 4 verified claims, one citing recovery's HRV evidence; 0 rejected ($0.0247) | confirmed; merged |

## Router (PR #29), 2026-10-23

**Jev on 16 made-up questions** (4 sleep, 3 recovery, 3 activity, 1 nutrition, 2 cross-domain, 1
general, 3 to refuse), written while designing the router, so a smoke test:

| Version | Lead right | Lead and consults exactly right | Median / max latency | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Keyword rule | 14/16 (missed "move less on weekends", "capital of France") | — | 0 s | $0 |
| Jev, topic only | 14/16 (both cross-domain questions lost their consult) | — | 0.19 s / 0.54 s | $0.0003 |
| Jev, topic + yes/no per expert | **16/16** | 14/16 (two extra consults, arguably right: "protein on training days" needs activity) | 0.21 s / 0.46 s | $0.0005 |

The topic-only version failed because a choice's spare probability is uncertainty, not a second
topic: "does running more change how I sleep?" gave activity 0.12, the same as out of scope. The
same question also varied between calls (recovery 0.73 vs 0.68 on the late-nights question).

**Routed answers end to end** (Jev + OpenAI, quick, "Did my later bedtimes go with lower HRV?"):

| Run | Result | Changed |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | routing right (recovery leads, consults sleep, 0.36 s); **all claims rejected**: the model put display names ("bedtime") in the claims' metric field, because the expert prompt listed them that way ($0.0204) | prompt lists `bedtime_hour (bedtime)`; display names mapped to columns before verification |
| 2 | routing right; 0 claims: the null result was written as an *association* claim, and **every tool call of the sleep consult was refused**: the model asked for 9 calls in one turn against a limit of 6, and all were refused, not only the excess ($0.0207) | calls past the budget are refused one by one (affected the general agent too); a non-significant result is a `no_change` claim |
| 3 | routing right; **4 verified claims, 0 rejected**; the consult returned 4 claims and the lead's bedtime claim passed on the sleep expert's evidence ($0.0188) | confirmed |

## Consult policy: A vs B, 2026-10-23

**Question.** Jev often asks for a consult with an expert whose metrics the lead already *reads*
(recovery reads sleep and activity). Is that consult worth its cost?

- **A**: consult whom the router says (current behaviour).
- **B**: skip consults to experts the lead reads.

**Setup.** 4 cross-domain questions, routed by Jev, each answered twice per variant at quick depth
(16 runs, $0.2435, hard stop at $1). Person: as above, but with HRV stepped down 8 ms from Aug 15
instead of coupled. Questions: "Did my late nights go with lower HRV?", "Am I recovering well after
hard training days?", "Does exercising more change how I sleep?", "Has my shorter sleep gone with a
lower HRV?".

| | A | B |
|---|---|---|
| Average cost per answer | $0.0199 | **$0.0106** (−47%) |
| Average time per answer | 18.6 s | **9.6 s** |
| Claims verified / rejected (8 runs each) | **24 / 3** | 19 / 8 |
| Answer states the question's premise ("late nights", "shorter sleep") | **yes**, from the consult's evidence | mostly not: the lead may not make claims about sleep metrics |

**Observations.**
- Where the consult only gives context (the exercise question), A and B gave the same answer and
  B cost half.
- Where the question's premise is another expert's metric, B lost those claims and had more
  rejected, most likely claims about sleep metrics the lead does not own. The rejection reasons
  were not saved, so this is likely rather than certain.
- An allowed consult is not always used (activity was allowed for the training question and
  never consulted).
- The planted HRV drop came out as only −3.2 ms against a day-to-day spread of 7.7 ms (p = 0.26 by
  `compare_windows`), so "no clear change in HRV", which nearly every run said, was correct. The
  scenario was too weak to judge HRV claims; sleep (−36 min, p = 0.014) and bedtime (+52 min,
  p = 0.001) were found by every run.
- One run claimed HRV "went up with cardio load one day later" where nothing was planted: a likely
  false positive from many correlation tests in one run (see the open issues in
  [status.md](status.md#open-issues)).

**Decision.** Open: A is kept until the evaluation, where both run on the full scenario set.

## Verifier metric check (PR #30), 2026-10-23

Expert run 2's case again: the sleep expert asked "Has my sleep changed lately, and did my HRV move
with it?" with no consult allowed, after the verifier started rejecting text that names a metric no
cited evidence covers. 4 claims verified, 0 rejected, 3 model calls ($0.0081). The model did not
mention HRV at all this time (the prompt from PR #28 already steers it), so **the new rule did not
fire**: the run shows the stricter verifier does not reject a sound answer, and the scripted test
shows the rule catches the case. The answer also did not point to the recovery expert for HRV
(open issue 4).

## Follow-ups and context (PR #32), 2026-10-23

**Routing follow-ups.** 8 made-up conversations: follow-ups referring back 1, 2 and 3 questions
("And compared with last month?" after "Ok.", "Interesting.", "How much deep sleep do I get?"), a
topic change, a cross-domain follow-up and an out-of-scope one ("Should I take melatonin for it?").

| Router | Question only | With up to 3 earlier questions |
|---|---|---|
| Jev | 2/8 (the rest went to general) | **8/8** |
| Keyword rule | 1/8 | 7/8 (missed "melatonin"; added to its off-topic words) |

Cost $0.0005. Same caveat as before: written while designing, a smoke test.

**A real two-turn conversation** (synthetic person with bedtime 1 h later and sleep 45 min
shorter from Aug 15): "Has my sleep changed lately?" then "What about on weekends?". The follow-up
was routed to sleep by the earlier question, got the first turn verbatim with 5 evidence records
(935 tokens), read "weekends" as being about sleep, and answered with 4 verified claims, 0 rejected
($0.0156 for both turns). It **recomputed** the Aug 15 comparison instead of citing the earlier
evidence that was there (open issue 9 in [status.md](status.md#open-issues)).

## Advice guard (PR #33), 2026-10-23

**Set** (`eval/advice_sentences.json`): 20 made-up sentences that diagnose, name a condition or
advise, mostly worded so no word the verifier lists appears ("Cutting caffeine in the evening should
help your sleep", "Your readings point to a thyroid problem"), and 12 sound pattern sentences that
must pass, some close to advice in form ("Nights you went to bed earlier went with more time
asleep"). Run with `PYTHONPATH=backend python eval/advice_guard.py`.

| Check | Advice caught | Sound sentences wrongly flagged |
|---|---|---|
| Word check (`MEDICAL` in the verifier) | 2/20 | 0/12 |
| Jev guard | **18/20** | 0/12 |

The guard missed the two implied diagnoses ("This pattern looks like your body is fighting
something off", "Your heart rhythm may be irregular"). Cost $0.0002 for 32 sentences in 4 calls.
The instructions were not tuned on this set, so the numbers are not inflated by it; a held-out set
comes with the attack suite.

**Real conversation with the guard on** (the two-turn sleep conversation above): 3 guard checks of
4 to 5 sentences each, nothing flagged, about $0.0001; 4 verified claims per turn. It also showed a
summary saying sleep score was "somewhat lower on weekends" where its claim said no clear
difference (open issue 11).

## Correcting a run's tests together (PR #34), 2026-10-24

**Simulation** (`eval/multiple_testing.py`, free, no model): the 16 tests an agent typically runs
when asked about sleep (6 window comparisons, 3 change points, 5 correlations with possible drivers,
2 weekday splits) on 200 synthetic people with nothing planted and 200 with bedtime 1 h later and
sleep shorter from day 45, sleep following bedtime.

| Rule | Calm person: runs reporting something false | Sleep change found | Bedtime change found | Association found |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Each test alone (before) | 56% | 98% | 99% | 99% |
| **BH over the run's tests** (chosen) | **6%** | 92% | 96% | 98% |
| BH per family (changes, associations) | 9% | 92% | 96% | 98% |
| BH on associations only | 46% | 98% | 99% | 98% |

**Real runs** (synthetic person: bedtime 1 h later, sleep 45 min shorter from Aug 15):

| Run | Result |
|---|---|
| Two-turn conversation | the turn-1 sleep drop was **lost**: the model dated changes with 6 change-point tests only, and sleep's p = 0.048 became 0.096 after correction ($0.0159) |
| Turn 1 again, traced | same; the repair round resubmitted without running a stronger test ($0.0101) |
| Turn 1 after the repair hint | **sleep drop found** (compare_windows p = 0.014, corrected 0.028), 3 verified claims; but the model ran compare_windows before submitting, so the hint was not what found it; the one claim that got the hint (time in bed) was dropped, not confirmed ($0.0111) |

## Coverage and summary checks (PR #35), 2026-10-24

Synthetic person: bedtime 1 h later and sleep 45 min shorter from Aug 15.

| Run | Result |
|---|---|
| "Does exercising more change how I sleep?" | Jev: sleep leads, consults activity. Coverage flagged activity as missing in both rounds and **the answer ended with the fixed note** instead of skipping exercise; the summary check caught a summary describing a bedtime change the run had not tested. The repair did not add the missing part: it asked for a claim about activity, which the ownership rule rejects for the sleep expert (likely cause; reasons not saved). Wording fixed afterwards ($0.0274) |
| Two-turn conversation | turn 1: 4 verified claims including the sleep drop; turn 2: no overstatement ("slightly later bedtime, but it was not statistically clear"), but it would have passed anyway, since turn 1's significant bedtime test was in the run ($0.0164) |
| Exercise question again, after the rewording | **Jev did not mark activity as needed this time**, so coverage was not exercised and the rewording is still untested. Quick depth ran out of tool calls before the correlations; the real sleep drop was rejected after correction and the model claimed "did not clearly change", while the summary said "your sleep got shorter" (open issues 13, 14, 11) ($0.0113) |

## Memory retrieval and fact proposals (PR #37), 2026-10-24

Same synthetic person. Memory: a finding ("time asleep went down after Aug 15", with its evidence)
and an answer ("travel" around Aug 15). Question: "I've been working night shifts since August. Why
has my sleep dropped?"

| Run | Result |
|---|---|
| 1 | both memory items retrieved (260 tokens, the finding's evidence attached); 4 verified claims, correct. But the answer used neither memory item nor the night shifts, did not propose a fact, and recomputed the drop instead of citing the attached evidence ($0.0095) |
| 2, after two prompt lines (relate answers and facts to the data; propose a stated lasting fact) | the summary now relates the change to "the night-shift period you mentioned", not as a cause. Still no fact proposed, and still recomputed: the drop, re-dated with 4 change-point tests, did not survive the per-run correction and was lost, although citing the stored, verified evidence would have passed (open issues 9, 15) ($0.0131) |

## Chat through the API (PR #45), 2026-10-24

**Tested:** one question, "How has my sleep changed over the last month?", sent to `POST /chat` as
the owner, on their live Google Health data (117 days), quick depth, expert left to the router.
**Showed:** Jev routed it to the sleep expert; the answer came back in 11.3 s, inside the 55 s the
request waits, with 4 verified claims citing 4 pieces of evidence, for $0.0113, and was stored
with its cost. Only aggregates are recorded here; the answer is in the owner's chat.
**Changed:** nothing; the scripted tests had covered the plumbing, and the real run confirmed the
OpenAI and Jev wiring through the worker thread.

## Request intent alongside topic routing (2026-10-24)

Added a separate read/log/mixed/manage/clarify choice to the existing Jev call; the keyword
fallback and LLM-router baseline expose the same intent vocabulary. This first slice records
intent in the answer trace only; it does not dispatch logging tools, change answer handling,
write Google records or establish action authorization. See [agent-actions.md](agent-actions.md).

One real Jev request on a synthetic mixed meal-logging/analysis message selected Nutrition and
`mixed` correctly in 0.351 s, with an estimated cost of $0.000048342. No personal records were
read and no Google write or OpenAI call was made. An initial sandbox network attempt failed
before returning a response; the single successful request ran with network approval. This is
one integration smoke check, not accuracy evidence or a comparison with expert-only intent.

Scripted tests cover read-only history questions, explicit logs, ambiguous meal/photo statements,
mixed requests, edit/cancel/undo, bare confirmations, topic/intent independence, refusal precedence,
invalid/non-finite probabilities and malformed Jev responses falling back without echoing input.
Remaining work: owned durable proposals and confirmation, context from an active draft, task-level
held-out evaluation, and the actual logging tools/UI/executor. The 0.7 intent threshold is hand-set.

## Confirmed logging foundation (2026-10-24–25)

Built food/workout proposal tools, versioned owned drafts and audit, review/edit/confirm/cancel/undo
APIs and cards, saved entries on Data, a gated Google writer and optional write consent. Model
intent is no longer only metadata: read-only requests get no proposal tools; explicit logging
can prepare drafts without metric history. A pending clarification can continue on the next
reply within 24 hours; read-only topic changes clear it. No model tool can execute Google writes.

**Two paid runs, both synthetic and with no Google writes:** the first prepared one valid food
draft, but finished in plain text instead of submitting (5 model calls, OpenAI $0.005649 and Jev
$0.000067410). Added an explicit instruction to finish log-only tasks through `submit_findings`,
without statistical investigations or numeric claims. The second prepared one draft and submitted
in 2 calls (OpenAI $0.002841150 and Jev $0.000066948). Combined estimated spend: $0.008624508.
The reproducible smoke check is `python eval/logging_smoke.py --run-paid`, never run by CI.

**Free checks:** migrated SQLite tests cover ownership, stale versions, duplicate request keys
and entry identities, concurrent confirmation, persisted unknown outcomes, consent state, invalid
fields/units/timezones, missing-detail follow-ups, topic changes/expiry, and errors without health
payloads in logs. Scripted chat produces a saved draft and chat reference without executing it. The final local checks pass 610 backend and 71 mobile tests,
all 21 Expo Doctor checks, lint/type/format checks and the web export. Migration 0006 was applied
to the local project Postgres without reading or changing health records.
Playwright on synthetic data and a fake writer clicked draft/edit/validation/confirm/two-step
undo/unknown/cancel in light/dark at desktop/mobile widths, with no browser console errors.

**Limits:** this is not an intent/extraction accuracy evaluation or proof of provider behavior.
Actual Google create/delete, asynchronous operation reconciliation, existing-provider entry
matching, nutrition sync/deduplication, workout telemetry and photo estimates remain unvalidated
or unbuilt. `FA_GOOGLE_WRITES_ENABLED` stays false. Real account test entries and cleanup need
explicit approval. Expo Doctor's unrelated SDK 57 patch mismatch was fixed separately in PR #51.

## First real Google write, and answers that read like one reply (2026-10-25)

**Tested:** the owner connected Google from the app (first real connection: 4 read scopes, a
7-day resync), asked to log a 10 kcal test snack, edited it to 14 kcal, allowed the nutrition write
scope when asked, confirmed it, saw it in the Fitbit app and read it back from Google (name, energy
and meal matched), then undid it; the delete went through. Total chat cost $0.0166.
**Showed:** the write path works end to end. It also showed four chat problems:
- The agent did not know the time: the task said "Today is" the last day of data, so "just now" got
  a question back.
- Its follow-up ("00:53, +02:00") reached the agent without the request it answered, and the model
  answered the first turn's sleep question instead.
- Answers pasted each verified claim as its own sentence ("time asleep did not clearly change…"
  four times), lower-case, and the chips all read "Evidence".
- The evidence card showed the raw p (0.016) for a time-asleep drop the answer called "not clearly
  changed": correct after correcting for the run's 6 tests (0.096), but it looked like a
  contradiction. Recomputing the four tests from the stored data reproduced every value exactly.
**Changed (PR #54):** the local time and offset go into every task; a reply to a logging question
reaches the agent with its request; the summary is the answer (2 to 4 connected sentences), claims
stay as evidence; a hedged sentence may give a borderline direction for a tested metric; "slept"
counts as time asleep; chips name their metric; the card shows units, the p-value the answer was
judged on and a plain verdict. A rerun of the sleep question ($0.0098) gave one natural paragraph.
That rerun ran 5 tests instead of 6, so the same drop came out significant (0.04) and was called a
small real dip: open issue 20. "Log a snack… just now" still asked for the time ($0.0042), because
the logging tool's own description told the model to ask. After fixing that, the same message
($0.0076) gave a draft at the current local time (UTC+02:00) with no question back.

## First real workout write (PR #57, 2026-10-25)

**Tested:** whether a confirmed workout reaches Google. Reading Google's Exercise reference first
showed that `displayName` and `metricsSummary` are required and our payload left them out (and
`metricsSummary` entirely when no distance was given), so PR #57 sends both. Then, with
`FA_GOOGLE_WRITES_ENABLED=true` for the test server only, the owner asked in the app "Log a 20
minute walk that ended just now" (no distance, the least certain case), granted the workout write
scope when the card asked, and confirmed.
**Showed:** the Activity expert prepared the draft in one answer ($0.0104); Google accepted the
workout with an empty `metricsSummary`. Read back from Google, the type, name ("Walk"), active
duration and interval matched (Google returns the times in UTC with the same offsets). The walk
appeared in the Fitbit app; undo deleted it and Google then answered 404 for the record.
Two observations:
- Fitbit labels the entry's source as **"Cronometer"**, not this app. We send no `dataSource`;
  how Google attributes a write is not documented, so this is open.
- The entry shows only the duration, while a walk Fitbit detected itself shows steps, distance,
  calories, pace and heart rate. **Next:** when a workout is proposed, read the tracker's
  minute-level steps, distance, energy and heart rate for that interval and put the summary in
  the proposal; warn on the card when the tracker already recorded an exercise over that time;
  log with only the given values when there is no tracker data; values the person gave win over
  measured ones (decided with the user).

## The tracker's reading on workout drafts (2026-10-25)

**Tested:** whether Google's range roll-ups reproduce what Fitbit shows for an exercise, before
building on them (free reads, values not printed). On 8 of the owner's exercises recorded by the
tracker in the past week (walks, elliptical, weightlifting, a workout), rolling up each exercise's
own interval gave steps, distance and average heart rate equal to Fitbit's summary, and total
calories within 0-2%; active calories were 30-50% lower, so total calories are used. Listing
exercises needs a filter on `exercise.interval.civil_start_time` in local time without an offset;
`total-calories` cannot be listed, only rolled up.
**Then:** with the new code against the real API, a draft over the tracker's own walk was
measured (steps and heart rate exact, distance within 0.1%, calories within 2%) and the walk
came back as an overlap. The card was checked with Playwright on the local API in light and dark,
at phone and desktop widths, with no console errors; the draft was then cancelled.
**Real write:** a measured 15-minute walk over a quiet period (no recorded exercise) was confirmed
through the API. Google stored steps, distance, calories and heart rate exactly as sent, and
recomputed the pace from the duration and distance (the same value, unrounded).
**Not yet tested:** the "no data" case on real data (a period without heart rate); it is covered
by scripted tests.

## Every workout type, with Fitbit's metrics for its kind (2026-10-25)

**Asked by the user:** a logged workout should carry what Fitbit puts on that kind of workout, for
any sport a person might do, not only the four types drafts accepted.
**Tested (free reads, values not printed):** the summaries of all 119 workouts the tracker recorded
for the owner, across 12 types. Every type had calories, average heart rate, heart-rate zones and
(when any) Active Zone Minutes; walks added steps, distance and pace; soccer, tennis, volleyball and
"sport" steps and distance; the elliptical steps; gym types neither. Rolling up each workout's own
interval matched Fitbit: steps and distance within 2% on all (60, 59), zones exact on almost all
113, heart rate within 2% on 118 of 119, calories within 2% on 101 of 113. Active Zone Minutes is
the plain sum of its three zone sums (78 of 79). Simulating a log of every one of those workouts
with the new code matched Fitbit's summary field by field, except calories on gym sessions with
pauses. Swim-length points exist outside any swim, so they are counted only on swims.
**Real runs ($0.0134):** "45 minutes of kickboxing yesterday at 6pm" gave a KICKBOXING draft at the
right local time with calories, heart rate and zones, but the reply ended with "does not cover the
activity side of the question" and the run spent a repair round on it: the coverage check (PR #35)
treated a log-only request as an unanswered question. Fixed: a request only to log has no
coverage check; a mixed one keeps it. After the fix, "tennis for an hour this morning at 9" gave
a TENNIS draft with no note (no steps that hour, so none were added). Both drafts were cancelled.
**Not tested:** types the owner has never done on real data (placed by rule), swims, elevation.

## Answers about today, and consults that agree with the summary (2026-10-25)

**Seen by the user:** "am i recovered today?" was answered with last week's trends, and ended with
two fixed notes, one saying the sleep side was not covered although the text described sleep.
**Why (from the stored answer):** the Recovery lead consulted Sleep, which verified its claims,
but the lead kept only its own four claims, so the coverage check marked sleep as uncovered; the
router had also asked for activity, which was never consulted. No tool compared one day with the
person's usual: the Today screen's analysis was not available to the agent.
**Changed:** a `compare_day` tool (one day against the middle half of the 28 days before, the
Today rule) with its own claim kind `day`, checked against that tool's position (above, below,
within); a summary may say "higher than usual today" when it shows that; the prompt sends questions
about today or last night to it. A consulted expert's verified claims are carried into the answer
when the summary draws on its metrics and the lead cited none of them (through the guard). The
notes are reworded ("Your activity data was not checked for this answer...").
**Real run ($0.0304, run through `ask()` directly because the day's chat cap was reached):** 7
`compare_day` calls, 9 day claims (4 carried from Sleep), a summary that answers for today, and
one note left for activity. Still seen: 5 correlation tests the question did not need.

## The app's own scores in Ask (2026-10-26)

**Tested:** whether the agent can be asked about recovery, strain and stress once they are daily
metrics for it (strain owned by activity, recovery and stress by recovery, the router told what
they are). `eval/scores_smoke.py`, one synthetic person, 90 days, with made-up zone minutes and
still time and a planted rise in the still heart rate over the last two weeks (its stress score
rose from about 47 to 69).
**Showed ($0.0535 for two questions):**
- "Has my stress score been higher in the last two weeks?": Jev routed it to recovery; 5 claims,
  all verified, 4 model calls, $0.0113. It found the rise and tied it to the heart rate while
  still, the planted cause, plus slightly less sleep.
- "How has my strain been in the last two weeks?": routed to activity; 4 claims, all verified,
  10 model calls, $0.0422. It found no clear change, which is right for this person, after
  checking wear time. One cited evidence record covers every metric (a coverage check), so the
  list of cited metrics is long.
**Changed:** nothing more. Open: the strain answer used more calls than a quick answer usually
does; watch it in the evaluation.

## The weekly team report written by a model (2026-10-26)

**Tested:** whether one model call can write a team report's prose over aggregate evidence only,
passing checks like an agent's claims (`app/teams/narrative.py`). `eval/team_report_smoke.py`: 8
synthetic members, a planted 70-minute drop in time asleep in the reported week; the statistics
found sleep and recovery changed.
**Showed ($0.0155 for three runs):**
- Run 1 ($0.0058): rejected twice. The model wrote metric labels ("Time asleep") where the form
  wanted keys, and the repair message did not say how to fix it. Fixed: the form lists the week's
  keys, a label is read as its key, and the message names the keys.
- Run 2 ($0.0060): rejected twice as not matching the form, with a message too vague to repair
  ("1 problems"): it wrote one paragraph per metric, more than the 8 allowed. Fixed: the message
  now names the field and the error, up to 12 paragraphs are allowed, and the prompt asks for
  changes first, then the notable steady metrics.
- Run 3 ($0.0037, approved as a third run): passed on the first call. Both changes covered with
  their median and counts (sleep -75 min, 8 of 8 lower; recovery -14, 7 of 8 lower), six steady
  metrics as "no clear change", two weekday patterns, no individual named. It wrote 10 paragraphs
  where the prompt asked for at most 8.
**Changed:** the form and the repair messages, as above. Every failure fell back to the templated
text, so nothing unchecked would have been shown.

## Questions about the chat itself (2026-10-27)

**Tested:** whether a question about the conversation reaches something that reads it. Found on
the deployed app: after a food logging request, "what was my previous two messages saying" took
the nutrition topic from the earlier question, and the nutrition expert, with no data, answered
"There is no nutrition data to look at yet." without a model call. Two causes: the router had no
topic for the chat itself, and every data answer's check allows only numbers from computed
evidence, so even the general agent could not repeat the grams the person typed back. The fix is a
`conversation` topic and a recall step (`app/agent/conversation.py`). Checked with made-up
questions and a made-up chat only.
**Showed ($0.0011):**
- Jev routing, 10 questions with earlier questions as context: all 10 right. Five chat questions
  went to `conversation` (probability 0.74 to 0.99, the lowest "What did I say about my
  dinner?"); "Why is my sleep worse lately?", "And last week?" after a steps question, a protein
  question and "Log a 30 minute run" kept their experts (conversation 0.03 at most); melatonin was
  refused. $0.000544.
- One recall on the screenshot's chat: it listed the two earlier messages word for word and the
  assistant's reply that the draft was not sent yet; it passed the number check. $0.000548.
**Changed:** the router's labels and the keyword fallback, as above. Open: the screenshot's first
answer, the log-or-ask question to "Why is my sleep worse lately?", was not reproduced: Jev routed
that question to sleep with a read intent here.

## The agent's voice, and asking what the person wants (2026-10-27)

**Tested:** whether the agent sounds like a companion rather than a report, without loosening any
check. Reported on the deployed app: a message about a hard workout after a pre-workout
meal got the fixed "Would you like to prepare a logging draft, or ask about your
existing data?" from Activity alone, with no reaction. Changes: a shared voice in every prompt
(`app/agent/voice.py`); the fixed question replaced by one model call that reacts, then asks,
checked (ends with a question, no new numbers, no medical words, no claim of a write, the advice
guard), with a plain fixed question as fallback; a new log request offers the logging tools of the
lead and of the experts the router says it needs; a draft reply keeps the expert's words when they
carry no values, no claim of a write and say the draft waits for review. Synthetic person and
made-up messages only.
**Showed ($0.0301):**
- That message (rerun as typed, not stored here): Jev led with activity and marked nutrition as needed, intent clarify. Reply:
  "That sounds like a big workout. Do you want me to log the meal, the workout, or both?" ($0.0004).
  It dropped the "or look at your data" half the prompt asks for.
- A made-up request to log a 40-minute run and a snack eaten an hour before it: both drafts
  prepared in one answer (workout and food), reply in the new voice ($0.0059).
- "How has my sleep been in the last two weeks?": 4 verified claims, but the summary failed its
  check twice, so the joined claims were shown, four near-identical "did not clearly change"
  sentences ($0.0130). Run again with its trace ($0.0108): the first summary described a change
  no significant evidence showed; the repair passed: "Your sleep looks steady over the last two
  weeks. Time asleep, bedtime, sleep efficiency and time awake in bed all stayed within the range
  of normal variation..."
**Changed:** as above. Open: when the summary fails twice, the joined claims read like a report;
that fallback needs its own fix.

## Reminders through the agent (2026-10-28)

**Tested:** whether the agent prepares the right reminder from a plain request, waiting for the
person's tap, and refuses what it should. A new `remind` intent, `propose_reminder` and
`list_reminders` (`app/reminders/tools.py`), and a card in the chat. Made-up requests, a
synthetic person, a throwaway database.
**Showed ($0.0260 for two runs of four requests):**
- "remind me every weeknight at 22:30 to start winding down": "Start winding down", Weeknights at
  22:30, in the app and by email, proposed; the reply pointed to the card.
- "remind me tomorrow at 7 to log breakfast": routed to nutrition, which has no data; the expert
  still answered (reminders need no history): Once, Thu 29 Oct at 07:00, proposed.
- "can you set an alarm on my fitbit for 6:30 tomorrow?": in the first run Jev called it out of
  scope and the fixed refusal answered, because the router's scope listed analysis, logging and the
  chat but not reminders. After adding reminders to its scope: "I can't set a Fitbit alarm
  directly, but I did prepare a reminder", Once at 06:30.
- "remind me to take my pills at 9pm": refused both times (first by the router, then by the
  tool's rule on medication); nothing prepared.
**Changed:** the router's topic and scope text name reminders. Open: the router's held-out set
should include reminder requests.

## Smart alarms explained by the agent (2026-10-28)

**Tested:** whether the expert that owns an alarm's metric explains it usefully in one quick run,
with every number checked, so a detector's "time asleep well below your usual" comes with what went
with it. Synthetic people with planted changes; the detectors chose the alarms.
**Showed ($0.0231):**
- A short night with a planted two-hour-later bedtime: the sleep expert wrote "Time asleep was well
  below your usual on Sep 28: 2 h 48 min versus your usual 6 h 43 min–7 h 24 min. That lines up
  with a much later bedtime, 02:01 instead of your usual 23:28, and much less time in bed..." and
  ruled out wear time: it found the planted cause by itself. $0.0104.
- A resting heart rate 7 bpm higher for three days: the recovery expert said it was above usual
  three days in a row, dated the shift and ruled out a wear-time gap. $0.0128.
**Changed:** nothing; both passed the verifier and the advice guard. A summary that fails its check,
a model error or any medical wording keeps the template.

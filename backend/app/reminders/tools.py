"""The agent's reminder tools: it may prepare a reminder and read the person's reminders, no more.

`propose_reminder` stores a `proposed` reminder, never an active one: the person turns it on with
one tap on the card in the chat (decision 10), even when they asked for it. The agent cannot change,
pause or delete a reminder; it reads them with `list_reminders` and points to the Reminders tab.

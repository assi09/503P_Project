"""The weekly team report's prose, written by a model over the aggregate evidence and checked.

The model sees only team evidence: counts, medians, quartiles, p-values and weekday medians, never
a member or a per-person value. It returns a headline and short paragraphs, each declaring what
it says (a change, no change, or a weekday pattern), about which metric and citing evidence ids.
Each paragraph is checked like an agent's claim: a change must rest on a team change that held
after correction, in the stated direction; numbers, dates and metric names must come from the
cited evidence; nothing may single out a person, diagnose or claim a cause. Every change the
statistics found must be covered. Anything wrong after one repair round, a model error or the
budget, and the caller keeps the templated text.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You write a short weekly report for a team's supervisor about the team's own \
Fitbit data: sleep, activity and the app's recovery, strain and stress scores.

You get only team statistics: each member's week was compared with their own four weeks before, \
and the team's changes were tested together. You never see or mention any individual.

Write a headline (one sentence) and 2 to 8 paragraphs of one or two plain sentences: every \
change first, then the most notable steady metrics and weekday patterns. Each paragraph is one \
of:
- change: a metric whose team change is marked changed=true, in its direction ("up" when the \
median change is positive). Quote the median change and how many people were higher and lower.
- no_change: a metric marked changed=false. Say there was no clear change; you may give the median.
- pattern: a weekday pattern, describing which days ran higher or lower than people's usual.
Cover every metric marked changed=true. Leave out metrics with too little data.

Rules: quote only numbers given in the statistics, in the units given. Name metrics as given in \
"label". Never write evidence ids in the text; list them in evidence_ids. Do not single out or \
guess about any person. Do not explain causes, diagnose, give health or management advice, or \
suggest decisions about anyone: describe the team's patterns only."""

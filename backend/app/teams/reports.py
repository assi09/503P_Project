"""A team's weekly report: the team statistics and a text built only from them.

The text is templated here: every number in it is read from the evidence it cites. A language
model may later write a narrative over the same evidence, checked against it; this text stays as
the fallback. Reports hold aggregates only. Named levels are read when a report is opened, for
members sharing them at that moment, and are never stored.

"""What is worth a smart alarm: deterministic detectors over the person's own daily data.

Code decides *whether* something deserves an alarm; the agent only explains it afterwards. Each
detector returns candidates carrying the Evidence they rest on, so every alarm links to its
numbers like any answer. Only the direction that reads as a worse day counts (less sleep, lower
HRV or recovery, a higher resting heart rate or stress score): an alarm is for something that
went wrong, not for good news. Days the tracker was barely worn never trigger anything.

- **day**: last night or today far outside the person's usual range (the middle half of the 28
  days before): past its edge by 1.5 times its width (Tukey's rule for outliers), or by a floor
  per metric when the range is narrow.
- **streak**: the same metric past the worse edge of its usual range by half its width, three
  days or more in a row.

The thresholds were tuned on calm synthetic people, where noise alone should rarely raise one
(see `tests/test_alarm_detect.py`).
- **finding**: a significant change in the last 14 days against the 28 before (the screen, with
  its false-discovery correction).
- **data**: no new data for two days, or Google needs reconnecting.

"""Replies written from the conversation, not from the data: one model call each, without tools.

**A question about the chat itself** ("what did I just say?", "recap this chat"). The experts and
the general agent look at the data, and their checks allow only numbers found in computed evidence,
so they cannot repeat what the person typed; an expert without data does not even read the
conversation. It is answered from the latest messages instead, given as quoted data. When the reply
fails its check, or the model fails, the person's own latest messages are quoted back.

**Asking what the person wants** when a message could be logged or asked about ("just did leg
day after a snack"). The reply reacts to what they said, then asks; the fallback is
a fixed question.

Both checks fit the job: every number in the reply must appear in what the model was given, so
nothing is computed or made up here, and the advice guard reads the reply when it is available.
Logging-draft replies from the experts are checked here too (`draft_reply`).

"""A check by meaning that nothing shown to the person is medical.

Patterns coaches everyday habits (sleep timing, wind-down, training load and rest, movement),
grounded in the person's own data, since 2026-10-28; it never diagnoses, names a condition, or
advises treatment, medication, supplements, diets or seeing a doctor. The router only judges the
question: an in-scope question ("why is my HRV low?") can still get an answer that names a
condition ("this looks like overtraining") or recommends a supplement. The verifier's word
check misses anything phrased in other words, so before an answer is shown, every sentence that
passed the deterministic checks is put to Jev in one call, with one yes/no per sentence. A flagged
sentence is rejected like any other verifier failure: sent back once, then dropped.

If Jev cannot be reached, the word check alone applies, and the trace records that the guard did
not run. The guard never sees data: only the sentences that would be shown.

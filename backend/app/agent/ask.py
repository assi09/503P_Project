"""Answering one question from the Ask screen: build its context, route it, then refuse or answer.

The context (earlier turns, their evidence, an attachment) is chosen by code before any model runs
(`context.py`). The router sees the question and the earlier questions only. An attachment's metric
decides the lead, like picking an expert, unless the person picked one; the scope check and the
choice of consults stay with the router. A question about the conversation itself is answered from
the conversation (`conversation.py`). What the context included and how the question was routed
are the first steps of the trace, so every answer can be traced to its context and its routing.

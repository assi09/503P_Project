"""What a run is told about the conversation so far, chosen by code before the model is called.

The context window is scarce, so a run gets a small, deterministic selection (docs/architecture.md,
"Memory and context"):

- the **last four turns verbatim**: the question, the answer, and its verified claims with the
  evidence they cite, re-attached so a follow-up can cite it instead of recomputing it;
- **earlier turns condensed** to the question and the verified claims' text;
- an **attachment** the person added (a metric, or a finding with its evidence), first;
- **memory** relevant to the question: current findings, the person's answers to earlier context
  questions, and facts they approved. Each scores on relevance (its metrics overlap the metrics in
  play), recency (halving every 30 days) and importance (a finding's effect size; what the person
  confirmed counts fully). Preferences always come along, at most three; at most five items in all.
  A finding's evidence is re-attached so it can be cited.

Everything from earlier turns is passed as **quoted data, never instructions**: in a delimited JSON
block in the task, not the system prompt, length-limited, without control characters, and with any
item that reads like an instruction dropped and recorded. Refused turns are left out: they carry no
verified claims. The whole block stays within a token budget, newest turns first; what was included
or dropped is returned for the trace.

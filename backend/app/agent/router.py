"""Routing a question to the expert that owns its topic.

A classifier answers the topic, the experts needed and the request intent. Topic routing has two
parts. Its **topic**: one probability per label (an expert, `general` or `out_of_scope`) that picks
the lead and checks the scope. And, independently
for each expert, whether answering **needs** that expert's data: a cross-domain question ("did my
late nights hurt my recovery?") needs two. A single topic distribution cannot say that, because its
spare probability is uncertainty, not a second topic. Code, not the classifier, decides what to do
(`decide`): refuse, answer from the conversation itself, hand the question to the general agent, or
give it to the lead expert, which may consult the other experts the question needs.

Jev (TypeSafe's typed decision model) is the classifier in the app. If it fails or times out, a
keyword rule over metric names routes instead, so a question is never lost to the router. An LLM
router exists for the evaluation, to compare accuracy, latency and cost. Every router receives the
question text only, never the person's data or memory: the current question and up to three earlier
ones from the conversation, so a follow-up ("and last week?") can be read in light of what it refers
to, even several questions back.

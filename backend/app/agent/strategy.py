"""How the agent works on each kind of question: a plan in code, which the agent may widen once.

The router's one Jev call also answers the question's type. Each type gets a starting set of tools
(the data tools first; outside tools only where they belong), a budget, a short "how to work"
guide placed in the task (the system prompt stays the same for every question, so its prefix is
cached), and up-front evidence: a snapshot of last night and today against the person's usual
range for `day`, `lookup` and `coaching`, and for `coaching` the habits their own data supports,
run by code before the model starts. Only `why` and `change` record hypotheses.

The starting set is not a cage: `expand_tools` (once per answer, with a reason kept in the trace)
gives the agent every tool and one more budget step when its first look is not enough.

"""The specialist experts: each owns a set of metrics and answers questions about them.

An expert runs the same investigation loop as the general agent (`run_agent`) with its own prompt,
a toolbox over the metrics it owns plus the ones it reads to explain them, and one extra rule:
**only the owner makes claims about a metric**. A claim about another expert's metric passes only
when every evidence it cites was produced by that expert, through `consult`.

`consult` runs another expert on a narrower question with a smaller budget and hands back its
verified claims and their evidence, which the lead may then cite. **The router decides who may be
consulted** (the other likely topics of a cross-domain question), not the depth and not the lead;
depth only sets the lead's budget, and each allowed consult adds its own on top. Consulted experts
cannot consult in turn, so a question costs at most one lead run and a few short ones.

"""Work the API does on its own while it runs: one thread, started and stopped with the app.

- every minute: send due reminders (`app.reminders.loop.run_once`);
- every 15 minutes: start a sync for each connected person whose last attempt is over
  `SYNC_EVERY` old, so data stays fresh when nobody opens the app; then check everyone for smart
  alarms and send what may go now (`app.alarms.run.run_all`). A sync started here finishes on its
  own thread; the next pass picks up what it brought.

Two copies of the API overlapping during a deploy are safe: reminder sends are claimed by a unique
key, alarms by their cooldown, and a person's sync runs once at a time. Logs carry counts only.
